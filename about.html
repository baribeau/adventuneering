Hey, nice to meet you! I'm Julia Baribeau, a graduate from Mechatronics Engineering at the 
University of Waterloo whose passions lie in sustainability, community, and adaptability. 
I hold a particular love for water.

I've had the awesome opportunity to do lots of backpacking in the last year, in South/Southeast Asia, Europe, 
and Canada. I learned about so many exciting projects during my travels, from massive city-scale 
water treatment plants to ancient sustainable agriculture strategies. This blog is an attempt
to share my learnings with as many people as possible, to inspire action, innovation, and hope for a 
sustainable future.

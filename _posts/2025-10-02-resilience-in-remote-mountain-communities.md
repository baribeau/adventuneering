When I was in Cambodia, I met a French woman in a boat on an ecotour of a floating village who heard I was interested in water sustainability and simply HAD to connect me with her Nepali tour guide, Ram.

I got breakfast with him in Kathmandu three days later, and he told me all about his home village in the Himalayas and how he has been able to leverage his role as an ecotourism and running guide to empower communities. 

After an earthquake, the spring that provided their water moved down the mountain. Ram organized an ultramarathon along the mountains as a fundraiser to build a road down the mountainside from their village to the new spring.

It's very difficult to ship supplies to some remote mountain communities which are only accessible by foot or yak. Ram equipped his runners with water filtration supplies that they could drop off at the villages hosting the aid stations along the way of the run!

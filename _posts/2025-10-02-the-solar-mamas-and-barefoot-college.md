I spent 2 months living and volunteering with the [Solar Mamas of Barefoot College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qqqVwM6bMM){:target="_blank"} during the daytime and helping in the Barefoot College plant nursery in the afternoons. 

This was my first experience solo travelling, my first time outside of North America, and the only time I've worked somewhere without sharing a spoken/written language with anyone in my workplace! 

My journey to Barefoot College had a lot of twists and turns in it, and I prefer storytelling with my voice instead of writing, so I've recorded this post as a podcast. I'm working on editing it and figuring out how to embed audio files in my website, then I'll post the podcast here (along with a transcript). Stay tuned!

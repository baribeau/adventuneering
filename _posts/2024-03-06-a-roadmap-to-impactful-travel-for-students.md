Travel is education. By setting up experiences to immerse ourselves in unfamiliar environments, we can learn language, adaptation, design, innovation, and culture, not to mention the benefits of meeting interesting people who open exciting doors of opportunity for us.  

In our globalized world where problems and solutions increasingly span across borders and continents, this education is as important as ever. 

I set out to travel because I wanted to better understand how the world really works. Along with this understanding, I wanted to augment my engineering education with examples of real-world designs and creative solutions from diverse cultures and countries. Equipped with that knowledge, I will better be able to come up with high-quality, sustainable solutions to problems I face at home.  

Plus, when I share these examples of innovation with the global community, it will empower people everywhere to take initiative and improve their own communities! That‚Äôs the goal of this blog, Adventure Engineering. 

I went from being a 20-year-old who had never left Canada except for 3 brief trips into the northern USA, to living full-time in a rural village in India for 2 months, working every day with a team of grandmother solar engineers whose languages I didn‚Äôt know. 

The [Solar Mamas of Barefoot College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qqqVwM6bMM) taught me not only how to build a solar lantern but also how to express myself and create deep bonds of friendship without relying on spoken language. By the end of my two months working with them every day, it felt like some of these women were my sisters, despite never having had a conversation. 

When I wasn‚Äôt in the solar workshop, I was in the plant nursery at Barefoot College, learning the basics of organic agriculture from the five nursery staff, who also taught me beginner‚Äôs Hindi, a few words of Marwari, and some Yoga. One day when I had a cough and sore throat, Hanuman Ji (the kind, caring man in charge of the plant nursery) jogged through the rows of plants, plucked a handful of different medicinal leaves, and showed me how to boil them into a bitter tea which he had me drink every few hours. It helped. 

I also spent some time with a different NGO named the Sehgal Foundation, attending a field visit to the tiny village of Ghaghas, Haryana. Locals showed me their community radio station (critical for fighting misinformation and taboos as well as running remote classes during COVID-19) and their gorgeous elementary school, equipped with vibrant murals, clean water, and bathrooms. One thing I hadn‚Äôt though of before was that access to water and bathrooms is especially critical for improving girls‚Äô education, because otherwise they must stay home when they get their period.  

In New Delhi, the largest city I had ever been in, I met with a lady named Sampada from the Indo-Universal Collaboration for Engineering Education (IUCEE), an organization encouraging young people to create impactful projects in their communities. She became one of my closest allies in India, not only encouraging my work and inviting me as a guest speaker at academic events, but also taking me in like one of her children and teaching me how to play Indian board games with her family. 

The experiences I had in India unlocked a whole new perspective on the world, as well as a fierce love for travel which has taken me to 14+ different countries since then. The connections I made with delightful people have stayed with me, and continue to provide joy and open doors in my life to this day. 

I'm writing this blog to answer the most common question I get from my fellow young people when I tell my stories: **"how do I make something like that happen in my life too?"**

## How to travel the world as a broke uni student -- and have a positive impact while doing it 

What you need: 

1. A destination where learning will be inevitable, and allies at that destination 

2. Funding 

3. To convince your parents to let you go üòâ 


### 1. Destination + Allies

I obtained a destination where learning will be inevitable and allies at that desination through "reaching out". I was authentic with my passions, told everyone I met about my aspirations, and **asked** for support. It can feel uncomfortable to ask for favours (such as introductions, a place to stay, etc.) but by being open, honest, vulnerable, and energetic I attracted support from profs, mentors, and extended network connections to find organizations and allies aligned with my goals and values.

Keep putting yourself out there, and be patient -- you will eventually bump into people with shared passions. Don't underestimate the power of a [friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend](https://science.howstuffworks.com/math-concepts/six-degrees-separation.htm).  

**Follow up**, for real! If someone mentions a person, project, or organization that sounds interesting to me, I always ask for more information, and especially for an introduction. When a kind person makes an offer of support, and I can tell they genuinely mean it, I take them up on it with gratitude.  
 
My mentor Stan says that enthusiastic youth have an extraordinary superpower: people are eager to help us out. It‚Äôs a trade, of sorts: we get help, and whoever helps us feels good about their contribution to guiding our life. If we can show our passion and energy, people will feel inspired and will be eager to guide us on a path they believe in. Our job is to keep in mind who we want to be and what impact we want to have, then lean into opportunities which aim us in that direction. 

It's easier to find allies first, then let __who you meet__ shape __where you go__. 

The more foreign my destination is compared to the familiar world I know, the more I learn about culture, language, and different approaches to solving problems. Getting out of my comfort zone is... well... uncomfortable, but every time I do, my comfort zone gets wider, and the incredible experiences that come with it make the initial discomfort well worth it. 

By going someplace with high contrast to my home, I not only learned about the culture at my destination, but also learned about my home culture by seeing my own customs (which I previously took for granted as ‚Äújust the way things are done‚Äù) stand out as foreign.  

So, as you talk to people, mention that you‚Äôre trying to travel to someplace different from home so you can grow and learn as much as possible. You never know who will have contacts in exciting projects around the world. 


### 2. Funding

Getting funding can be daunting to think about, but there is a lot of funding out there if you get involved in the right spaces. 

You‚Äôll need the money for your trip (flights, visa fees, travel insurance, immunizations, transportation, accommodations, food) and to acquire whatever additional resources you may need for your positive-impact project. (In my case, these were things such as an audio recorder and clip-on microphone to interview the Solar Mamas.) 

If you're in school, the first place to look is for "international experience" **bursaries and scholarships** at your institution. Most require applications, but some of those applications are as simple as filling a few boxes with personal information to verify that you qualify.  

These grants can help offset the cost of your trip, but may not cover it entirely. 

Since you're traveling to try and have an impact, look into **pitch competitions**, especially for social entrepreneurship. This is where I got the majority of my funding.  

Some programs, like [GreenHouse at UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/united-college/greenhouse), don‚Äôt require you to have any entrepreneurial experience or even any project ideas when you enroll, as they will teach and guide you during the program. Keep an eye out for programs like this at your own institutions! 

Other financial sources include: 

* your own **savings** from working 
  - (such as through co-op/internships) 

* **crowdfunding** 
  - (I'm not personally experienced with this one, but there are plenty of other blogs out there to reference) 

* **government volunteering programs** like the [International Youth Internship Program or Volunteer Cooperation Program](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/study_work_travel-etude_travail_voyage/volunteer_internships-benevolat_stages.aspx?lang=eng) for Canadians.
  - (With programs like these, you usually apply for specific postings, and may have less liberty to focus on your own project. This might be a good thing, if you would rather contribute to existing solutions instead of piloting your own.) 

* financial support from **family** 
  - (if your parents have the capacity to support, ask! I'm not personally experienced with this situation, but I suspect it might make step 3 (‚Äúconvince your parents to let you go‚Äù) more complicated -- I think it was easier to convince my parents I was responsible enough to go on the trip because I amassed the funding myself.) 

### 3. Convince your parents to let you go

Getting your parents' blessing to go on an international trip can be tricky and depends on your situation. In my case, my parents were worried about me (a young woman) going alone to a foreign country, especially one where I would [so obviously be a foreigner](https://www.pinkcitypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Youth-Day-Poornima-xlxl2kx2.jpg) (I'm white). They were scared I would be a target to be taken advantage of, robbed, sexually harassed, kidnapped, or any of the other nightmarish worries parents have about their kids ‚Äì not to mention that I‚Äôm deathly [allergic](https://foodallergycanada.ca/food-allergy-basics/food-allergies-101/what-are-food-allergies/) to dairy and lentils, two of the main dietary staples in India. 

I won my parents‚Äô blessing through organization and persistence, proving to them that I am thinking about what could go wrong and actively preparing for it. 

These are some of the steps I took to convince my parents I would be ok in India: 

  * Providing a detailed itinerary for my 2-month trip showing that I would never truly be alone, with addresses of my destinations, flight numbers, and other logistical details 

  * Providing a spreadsheet of contact information of allies who will support me while I'm away and can come to my rescue if needed 

  * Making preparatory video calls between my parents and my allies so my parents could scope out the situation themselves and judge the character of the people I would be with 

  * Giving 24/7 access to my location on Google Maps to my parents and one highly trusted ally in India, who they could contact if something happened to me 

  * Registering with the Canadian consulate in India so the Canadian government can track me down in case of emergency (e.g. natural disaster, war, etc.) 

  * Carrying a powerbank to keep my phone charged 

  * Always carrying a notebook with emergency contacts, in case my phone dies or breaks 

  * Stocking up on extra-strong sunscreen 

  * Bringing a LifeStraw water filter attachment in my water bottle 

  * Packing medications, including iron and B-12 supplements since I can‚Äôt have lentils or dairy which typically provide those nutrients to the population of Rajasthan, and Pepto-Bismol/ rehydration salts/antibiotics in case of traveler‚Äôs diarrhea 

  * Bringing a stock of 6 EpiPens in heat-protective cases to save my life in case I‚Äôm accidentally exposed to one of my food allergies 

  * Beginning to learn Hindi, especially the names of my allergens 

Most of the items on the above list came from a concerned person asking me, ‚Äúwhat if...?,‚Äù then I think about the answer and what I would want or need to prevent or cope with that scenario. For example: 

 > Mom: ‚ÄúWhat if a food vendor doesn‚Äôt speak English or French ‚Äì how will you communicate your allergies?‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how to say it in Hindi, and if that fails, here‚Äôs the first page of my notebook with pictograms. I‚Äôll always be with companions, and if they know, they can ask for me.‚Äù 

 > Mom: ‚ÄúWhat if they still don‚Äôt understand, and serve you something you‚Äôre allergic to? Food allergies are basically non-existent in India.‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúIf I accidentally eat something I can‚Äôt, I‚Äôll have 2 EpiPens on me at all times and extra backups in my suitcase.‚Äù 

 > Mom: ‚ÄúWhat if your epinephrine is made ineffective from overheating?‚Äù  

Me: ‚ÄúOk, these evaporative cooling packs will prevent it from overheating, even if I have no access to electricity to cool ice packs.‚Äù 

Whatever your loved ones' concerns are, listen to them! Your parents have probably heard of more atrocities in the world than you have, just by nature of being alive longer. Take their concerns seriously -- they are real possibilities. Take action to mitigate the risks, and then show them how you are taking responsibility for your safety. 

### Other tips

Here‚Äôs a list of documents, logistical tasks, and other tips you may need to prepare for your experience: 

* **Passport** (valid for at least 6 months after your planned return date) 

* **Visa** for the country you‚Äôre visiting (tourist/student/volunteering/working visa, depending on what you‚Äôll be doing). START THIS APPLICATION EARLY!!! Give yourself at least a month more than you expect you‚Äôll need in case of contingency like processing delays and complications. You might need the following for your visa application: 

  - Letter of support/invitation from the organization you intend to volunteer for, stating the address you‚Äôll be staying at, what you will be doing, and any accommodations or compensation they will provide for you 

  - Bank account statement (sometimes needed as proof of funds) 

  - Proof of address (like a utility bill with your name and address on it or your lease) 

  - Proof of enrollment from your academic institution 

  - Passport photo (you can often get these taken at department stores or convenience stores like Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada) 

  - Online application forms specific to the visa you‚Äôre applying for 

* Yellow fever immunization card (depending on the country you‚Äôre going to and where you‚Äôve been recently) 

* Travel immunizations specific to your destination 

* COVID-19 proof of vaccination 

* Travel insurance (check if you have travel insurance coverage through your school, parents, work, or credit cards. Otherwise, I have used [Travel Guard](https://www.travelguard.ca/) as trip cancellation insurance to supplement my university‚Äôs travel health coverage, and [SafteyWing Nomad Insurance](https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance) to cover both health and trip insurance in multiple countries when I had no other coverage.) 
  - The above links are not sponsored, I just like their deals.

* 2 spare recent passport photos, printed 2‚Äùx2‚Äù (helpful in case of replacing lost documents at your embassy, or if you encounter surprise visa requirements at the border) 

* Scanned copies of your ID and travel documents
  - Store printed copies in your bag with you, and digital copies online where you and your emergency contact(s) can access them.

* Register with your [national consulate](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration) so they can reach you in case of emergency, and save [national emergency numbers](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance) in your phone and written on paper.  

* A budget for your trip/project (helpful for applying for funding and staying organized) 

* Pack climate- and culture-appropriate clothing. Search up ‚Äúpacking list \<*your destination*\>‚Äù and read a few different lists to judge what else you will need to pack. Don‚Äôt forget items like an outlet adapter, a combination lock, and a waterproof bag (like a zipper seal bag) for important documents.

* Exchange some cash into the currency of your destination before you leave home. 

* Some countries require pristine (new/undamaged) USD cash bills to pay for entry on arrival. Research your destination, and bring some USD cash. The ATMs in the airport arrival don‚Äôt always work. 

 
### For University of Waterloo co-op students 

One of the most common questions I get is how to make international volunteer experiences count for co-op credits at our school.  

First, let me say this: I didn‚Äôt get a co-op credit for my term in India. My trip and project were self-directed and involved a few different organizations, so finding someone to be my manager and evaluate my work for the WaterlooWorks evaluations would have been a hassle. I had already completed the 5 co-op credits I needed to graduate, so I had the freedom to take co-op term #6 as a freebie and I didn‚Äôt bother pursuing co-op accreditation. So, I‚Äôm no expert, but here‚Äôs what I know from my co-op experience and from the [Work Abroad Co-op Requirements](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/work-abroad/before-you-go/co-op-requirements) webpage.

The easiest way to ensure your term will count is to apply through WaterlooWorks (WW). If you can find an impactful international work opportunity posted on WW that interests you, it should already be approved to meet the work term requirements, so apply as normal through the interview/rank/match process. 

If you found or created an opportunity outside of WW, use the [‚ÄúArranged Own Job‚Äù (AOJ) form](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/arrange-your-own-job) to register the opportunity within the UW co-op process. You will need to know details such the position title and description, start/end dates, rate of pay (or alternative remuneration ‚Äì see below), and your supervisor's name/department/contact information. 

International positions have more flexibility when it comes to UW‚Äôs compensation requirements. Unpaid/underpaid positions can be approved depending on the local market standards, as long as some form of compensation is provided (e.g. flights, meals, accommodations, local travel, etc.). Read the ‚ÄúUnpaid/underpaid jobs located internationally (outside of Canada/USA)‚Äù section of the [co-op roles and responsibilities](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/supports-and-resources/co-op-rights-and-responsibilities#unpaid-underpaid) webpage. 

To be approved for an international co-op term, you need to satisfy the [UW Work Abroad Co-op Requirements](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/work-abroad/before-you-go/co-op-requirements), which includes being 18 years old, in full-time studies, proficient in English, and having no criminal record, among other requirements. Your destination must **not** be high risk (‚Äúavoid non-essential travel‚Äù or ‚Äúavoid all travel‚Äù) according to the [Government of Canada travel advisories](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories). 

You will have to complete a Risk Management Form in WaterlooWorks, and pass the ‚ÄúCo-op Work Term Readiness Training‚Äù course on LEARN with at least an 80%. The course will appear on your LEARN homepage when your term abroad is approved. 

I got most of the above information from the [Work Abroad Co-op Requirements](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/work-abroad/before-you-go/co-op-requirements) webpage on the University of Waterloo website. Use that website as your primary source of information. 

Talk to your [co-op advisor](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/contact-co-operative-education/your-co-op-advisors) if you have any questions. 
 

### Conclusion

This road map I have presented to achieve your impactful, educational travel dreams is based on my own experience. This is just what I figured out while methodically taking down barriers to achieve my own dreams; not everything about my experience will apply to your experience, and you might encounter different barriers that I haven‚Äôt addressed here.  

Each time a barrier appears which seems to be saying that it‚Äôs not possible to do what you have set out to do, don‚Äôt lose hope. Maintain the resilience (or stubbornness, depending on who you ask) to keep finding your way around each obstacle, defining your own path.  

Patience, determination, resourcefulness, and creativity will be major skills you‚Äôll have to call upon. Before you know it, you‚Äôll be arriving at your destination in a whirlwind of introductions and new experiences, wondering how the heck you actually made it happen. 

If you‚Äôre interested in more details about my specific experience in India with the Solar Mamas, along with all the roadblocks and project pivots along the way, I‚Äôll be posting my full story soon!
